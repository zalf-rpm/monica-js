**(still experimental) JavaScript port of MONICA model**

"_MONICA is a dynamic, process-based simulation model which describes transport and bio-chemical turn-over of carbon, nitrogen and water in agro-ecosystems. On daily time steps the most important processes in soil and plant are modelled mechanistically. They are linked in such way that feed-back relations of the single processes are reproduced as close to nature as possible. MONICA works one dimensional and represents a space of 1 m² surface area and 2 m depth.
The acronym MONICA is derived from „MOdel of Nitrogen and Carbon dynamics in Agro-ecosystems”._"
